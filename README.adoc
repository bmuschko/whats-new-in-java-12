Source code for the book https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/whats-new-in/9781492058243/["What's New in Java 12?"], A Developer-Focused Guide to the Latest Features and JVM Changes, published by Benjamin Muschko for O'Reilly Media Inc.

Demonstrates some of the new features and library changes in Java 12 in a test-driven approach with JUnit 5. All test cases live in `src/test/java`. The main source code under `src/main/java` contains examples that demonstrate the use of open source libraries as a replacement for the removed Java EE modules.
